# obj-traverse

Small and lightweight library that enables you to traverse deep nested objects and edit them
<br/><br/>


## Getting Started

1. Run ```npm i obj-traverse --save```
2. Import library:<br/>
a) ```var objTraverse = require('obj-traverse/lib/obj-traverse');``` (look at 3a)<br/>
b) ES6: ```import * as objTraverse from 'obj-traverse/lib/obj-traverse';``` (look at 3a)<br/>
c) ES6: ``` import { findAll } from 'obj-traverse/lib/obj-traverse'; ``` (look at 3b)<br/>
3. Use it:<br/>
a) ``` objTraverse.findAll(...) ```<br/>
b) ``` findAll(...) ```<br/>


## Demo

You can visit http://dominik791.github.io/obj-traverse-demo and play with the library


## API

1. ```findFirst(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy)```

   It iterates through each deep nested object and if finds object that has prop and value specified in ```objToFindBy```
   argument, it stops the walk and returns reference to this object. If none is found, it returns false.
   
   <br/>

   <br/>
   
   Please note that the method checks all children on current level and then it deepens to the next level - grandchildren.


2. ```findAll(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy)```

   It iterates through each deep nested object and for every found object that has prop and value specified in
   ```objToFindBy``` argument, it pushes reference of this object to the result array. When it finishes the walk, it returns the array.
   If none is found, it returns false.

3. ```findAndModifyFirst(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy, replacementObj)```
 
   It iterates through each deep nested object and if finds object that has prop and value specified in ```objToFindBy```
   argument, it replaces the current object with ```replacementObj```, stops recursive walk and returns reference to the root object.
   If none is found, it returns false.

4. ```findAndModifyAll(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy, replacementObj)```
 
   It iterates through each deep nested object and for every found object that has prop and value specified in
   ```objToFindBy``` argument, it replaces the current object with ```replacementObj``` and returns reference to the root object.
   If none is found, it returns false.

5. ```findAndDeleteFirst(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy)```
 
   It iterates through each deep nested object and if finds object that has prop and value specified in ```objToFindBy```
   argument, it deletes it, stops the walk and returns reference to the root object.
   If none is found, it returns false.

6. ```findAndDeleteAll(tree, childrenKey, objToFindBy)```
 
   It iterates through each deep nested object and if finds object that has prop and value specified in ```objToFindBy```
   argument, it deletes it, continue the walk and returns reference to the root object once finished.
   If none of objects is found, it returns false.
